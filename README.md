# GitHub Default Community Files

Holds default files for repositories in my professional GitHub account (simonkurtz-MSFT). See support files [here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).

Other files such as LICENSE and DISCLAIMER.md are here for reference and are not automatically linked in other repositories.
